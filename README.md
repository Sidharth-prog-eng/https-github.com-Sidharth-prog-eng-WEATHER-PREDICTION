# WEATHER-PREDICTION
The Weather Prediction project uses Python to fetch real-time weather data for a specified city via an API. It provides up-to-date forecasts, including temperature, humidity, and conditions, based on the current date and time. The project demonstrates working with APIs, processing real-time data, and displaying dynamic weather information.
